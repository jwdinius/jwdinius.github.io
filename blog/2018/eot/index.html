    <h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>While I was working with the Object Detection and Tracking team for the Next-Generation Vehicle at Ford, I was really challenged by the problem of short- and medium-range radar in an automotive context.  Coming from aerospace, where multiple detections from a single object were exceedingly rare, I was able to straightforwardly associate measurements with tracks.  In the world of automotive radar, this was no longer the case.  I got to thinking about many approaches of how to solve this problem, and none were all that great.</p>

<p>After leaving Ford, I had a different, but related, problem where I needed to track multiple extended objects.  I had limited time to implement a solution, and there was insufficient signal processing done beforehand.  I had to process a signal with a limited feature set for discerning objects-to-track vs. stationary objects, track those objects reliably, and create collision avoidance logic using the tracks.  While doing research initially, I had found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00970.pdf">this paper</a> that discussed different approaches for tracking extended objects.  I had originally intended to implement one of the algorithms the authors had discussed, but I didn’t have sufficient time.  The approach was a tough sell to management as it was quite high risk.</p>

<p>Now that I am no longer working on that project, I have decided to revisit the algorithm and see what I can make of it.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>It’s probably best to just demonstrate the problem via a <a href="https://youtu.be/mPgtW6CdXIU">video</a>.</p>

<p>You can see that a grouping of points, varying in number at each time step, moves with a high degree of correlation over time.  It seems that the points themselves have a spread that lies along the apparent direction of motion.  Furthermore, it seems one could encapsulate the points within a convex shape, the size, orientation, and speed of which could be tracked via standard methods, i.e. a Kalman filter.  Well, that’s what I’m building up to, so far I just have the simulated sensor model up and running, so I’ll talk about that.</p>

<h3 id="the-code">The Code</h3>

<p>The testbed used to make the video referenced above is <a href="https://juce.com/">Juce</a>, a platform comparable to QT in terms of its capabilities.  Though Juce is typically used for audio applications, its graphical front-end makes it very appealing for design and analysis of other embedded systems.  One such application I have seen it used for is autonomous vehicles, so I thought it would work well here.  I was able to obtain a personal license to explore Juce’s capabilities towards the problem at-hand.</p>

<p>Typically, sensors update via udp on a regular clock cycle.  To simulate the sensor, I tied the update of the sensor telemetry to a timer thread.  The sensor “listens” to the timer thread; upon completion of the timer’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run()</code> method, which includes a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sleep</code>, the sensor’s telemetry is updated via a simple motion model coupled with a random sampling about the surface of an extended object.  The sleep-update paradigm is a way of enforcing a timing constraint for testing signal processing algorithms in real-time, with a reliable clock rate.</p>

<p>The measurement model itself comes from the author’s original <a href="https://github.com/Fusion-Goettingen/ExtendedObjectTracking">Matlab implementation</a> and can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The number of detections on each frame follows a Poisson distribution</li>
  <li>The object is assumed to be aligned along it’s direction of travel</li>
  <li>The detections from the object are normally-distributed about an ellipse</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whats-coming-next">What’s Coming Next?</h3>

<p>I intend to update my <a href="https://github.com/jwdinius/extended-object-tracking">repo</a> with an extended Kalman filter model implementing the algorithm discussed in the previously mentioned paper.  I don’t have an ETC on this at the moment, so stay tuned.  Cheers!</p>
