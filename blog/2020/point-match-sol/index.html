    <h1 class="post-title">Point Cloud Registration as Optimization, Code Implementation</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">March 1, 2020</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>tl; dr:  Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/jwdinius/point-registration-with-relaxation">link</a> to the GitHub repo.  The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> is pretty descriptive.  Clone it, fork it, whatever.  You should be able to get up-and-running quickly.</p>

<p>In previous posts, <a href="https://jwdinius.github.io/blog/2019/point-match/">this one</a> and <a href="https://jwdinius.github.io/blog/2019/point-match-cont/">this one</a>, I set up a quadratic optimization problem for finding the best correspondences between two point sets, also called <em>clouds</em>.  If you haven’t already seen these, I recommend going back and looking at them before going through the this post.  Your call.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-context">A bit of context</h2>
<p>At last year’s CVPR, I sat through a really cool talk presenting the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03483">SDRSAC paper</a>.  The results presented seemed really promising and I wanted to see if I could reproduce them.  There were a lot of issues encountered along the way.  In this post, I will highlight and dig deeper into some of these issues.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>

<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>
<p>At this point, I use <a href="www.docker.com">Docker</a> for all of my personal projects.  I just find that it is a more flexible solution than requiring users to install a bunch of dependencies on their machine.  There’s an added bonus as well:  <em>new users can reproduce original results with little-to-no added friction</em>.</p>

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>I chose C++ because performance was a concern.  I wanted to have the performance of a strongly-typed language combined with the large suite of supporting libraries written in it.  To handle automatic resource management, I compiled using the C++-14 standard.  This allowed transfer of ownership of resources to smart pointers through the use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::make_unique</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::make_shared</code> functions introduced by the C++-14 standard.</p>

<h3 id="linear-algebra-library">Linear algebra library</h3>
<p>Despite <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen</a>’s popularity over the last decade, I decided to go with <a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a>.  The reasons for my choice include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documentation: <em>the wiki is great</em></li>
  <li><a href="http://nghiaho.com/?p=1726">Speed</a></li>
  <li>Matlab-like syntax: <em>though 0-based indexing of C++ is still used</em></li>
  <li>Functionality - <em>reshaping, resampling, and operations like singular-value decomposition come for free</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="optimization">Optimization</h3>

<h4 id="nonlinear-optimization-framework">Nonlinear optimization framework</h4>
<p>I had originally wanted to use a semidefinite solver, SDP,  like the original SDRSAC work, but finding such a solver proved to be a major roadblock.  My requirements for the solver were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It had to be free - <em>I wanted to be able to share this work with everyone</em></li>
  <li>It had to be well-supported - <em>I didn’t want to spend a lot of time debugging an external</em></li>
  <li>It had to have a simple interface - <em>I wanted to be able to define the optimization objective in a clear, intuitive format</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Some libraries considered were <a href="https://github.com/coin-or/Csdp/wiki">CSDP</a>, <a href="http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/">SDPA</a>, and <a href="http://ensmallen.org/">Ensmallen</a>, however <em>none</em> of these libraries, when evaluated, met the three criteria above.</p>

<p>The choice of semidefinite solver was driven primarily by the structure of the optimization objective, however when looking into some comparisons, like in Section 5.4 of this <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.140.910&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a>, I convinced myself that a more general optimization framework could be effective, so I decided to go with <a href="https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/">IPOPT</a>.  IPOPT meets all of the above requirements and, as a bonus, I have used it before in other projects; see <a href="https://jwdinius.github.io/blog/2018/udacity_sdcnd/">this</a>.</p>

<p>The translation of the optimization constraints was also <em>much</em> easier for the IPOPT formulation when compared to the SDP formulation.  Don’t take my word for it, though:  compare the constraints presented in the posts referenced above to the ones in the SDRSAC paper.</p>

<h4 id="linear-correction">Linear correction</h4>
<p>As in the SDRSAC paper, depending upon the convergence criteria imposed on the nonlinear optimizer, the resulting solution to the optimization objective <em>may not be a valid member of the desired solution space</em>!  To fix this, I needed to find an implementation of something akin to the <a href="http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e176/lectures/NM/node32.html">simplex algorithm</a> for projecting the solution to the nonlinear problem onto the solution space: 0 for non-matches, 1 for matches.  I was able to find an implementation in Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization/lp/lp">ORTools</a> which meets the requirements I outlined above for the nonlinear optimizer above.</p>

<h3 id="data-creation-and-performance-analysis">Data creation and performance analysis</h3>
<p>I knew that I wanted to be able to easily create datasets, run the optimization, and quickly analyze the results graphically.  The native C++ support for such capabilities is not very flexible, so I decided to wrap the main function call in a Pythonic wrapper using <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Boost::Python</code></a>.  This allowed me to use the <a href="https://numpy.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy</code></a> suite of tools for creating point clouds to be passed to the algorithm and the plotting capabilities of <a href="https://matplotlib.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matplotlib</code></a> to visualize the output.  I found that, by writing the wrapper, it was a lot easier to identify system-level issues while developing the algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Testing is a big part of my approach to application development.  Though I didn’t follow the full principles of TDD, I did try to capture test cases for all function calls under both nominal and off-nominal conditions.  This approach gave me the confidence to try out things quickly and verify if the expected behavior was observed.  As a follow-on, it allowed me to catch bugs and identify corner-cases much more quickly than traditional approaches; i.e. top-down development with little to no unit testing.</p>

<p>To automatically execute and generate a test report, I built my unit tests using <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_45_0/libs/test/doc/html/utf.html">Boost’s unit test</a>.  After building the shared library, the unit tests can be built with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make test</code> and the pass/fail data is reported automatically.</p>

<h2 id="code-quality-and-standards-checking">Code quality and standards-checking</h2>
<p>I have included a wrapper script in the GitHub repo that does a quick static code check using <a href="https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cpplint</code></a>, which verifies that the code meets common style conventions for C++.  This helps to keep the repo’s implementation consistent should additional features be added down the road.</p>

<h1 id="summary-and-future-work">Summary and future work</h1>
<p>In this post, I presented my design choices for the computational solution to the problem of point cloud matching, which I developed in pair of previous posts.  I have made the work available for others to use and contribute to, should they wish to do so.  Some things that I would like to add to the repo would be in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Continuous Integration, CI - <em>this way I can automatically check that all tests pass before merging new commits</em></li>
  <li>Code coverage tests - <em>I’d really like to make sure that there are no corner cases that I am neglecting in my test-suite</em></li>
  <li>Adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem#Finding_maximum_cliques_in_arbitrary_graphs">maximum clique algorithm</a> correspondence solver - <em>more on this to come in a future post!</em></li>
</ul>
