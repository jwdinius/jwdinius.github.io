My name is Joe Dinius.  I have spent the last 15+ years working as an autonomous systems engineer in the aerospace, automotive, and robotics industries; most of this time spent in research and development.  While I cannot discuss what I have worked on professionally over the years, I have worked on a number of interesting side projects whose results and methodologies I share within this personal website.

I have setup this site to be a collection of posts related to ongoing work that I'm engaged in.  Once a project reaches a sufficient level of maturity, I will create a writeup that presents the following:

* A concise problem formulation
* The approach I have taken to solve the formulated problem
* Analysis and summary of my proposed solution
* Some suggestions for future work

Most posts have comments enabled, and I encourage visitors to contribute their opinions.  I only ask that the comments be civil and aligned with the post.  You will find links to my social media accounts below, as well as a link to email me.  Thanks for visiting!
