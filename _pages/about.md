My name is Joseph Dinius.  I have spent the last 10+ years working as an engineer in aerospace and automotive industries; most of that time spent in research and development (R&D).  While I am not at liberty to go into great detail on the projects I have worked on professionally over the years, I have worked on a number of interesting projects on the side that I can share and I have created this site to do just that.

I have setup this site to be a collection of posts related to ongoing work that I'm engaged in.  As maturity of the work progresses, and it makes sense to do so, I will create portfolio projects that represent a concise problem formulation, the approach I have taken to solve that problem, and some suggestions for future work.
