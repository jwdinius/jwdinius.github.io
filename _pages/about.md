My name is Joe Dinius.  I have spent the last 10+ years working as an engineer in the aerospace and automotive industries; most of that time spent in research and development.  While I cannot discuss projects I have worked on professionally over the years, I have worked on a number of interesting projects on the side that I would like to share.

I have setup this site to be a collection of posts related to ongoing work that I'm engaged in.  As maturity of the work progresses, I will create portfolio projects that represent a concise problem formulation, the approach I have taken to solve that problem, and some suggestions for future work.

Most posts have comments enabled, and I encourage visitors to contribute their opinions; I only ask that the comments be civil and aligned with the post.  You will find links to my social media accounts below, as well as a link to email me.  Thanks for visiting!
