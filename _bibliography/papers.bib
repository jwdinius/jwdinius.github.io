    abstract = "The theoretical basis for the Lyapunov exponents of continuous- and discrete-time dynamical systems is developed, with the inclusion of the statement and proof of the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem of Oseledec. The numerical challenges and algorithms to approximate Lyapunov exponents and vectors are described, with multiple illustrative examples. A novel generalized impulsive collision rule is derived for particle systems interacting pairwise. This collision rule is constructed to address the question of whether or not the quantitative measures of chaos (e.g. Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy) can be reduced in these systems. Major results from previous studies of hard-disk systems, which interact via elastic collisions, are summarized and used as a framework for the study of the generalized collision rule. Numerical comparisons between the elastic and new generalized rules reveal many qualitatively different features between the two rules. Chaos reduction in the new rule through appropriate parameter choice is demonstrated, but not without affecting the structural properties of the Lyapunov spectra (e.g. symmetry and conjugate-pairing) and of the tangent space decomposition (e.g. hyperbolicity and domination of the Oseledec splitting). A novel measure of the degree of domination of the Oseledec splitting is developed for assessing the impact of fluctuations in the local Lyapunov exponents on the observation of coherent structures in perturbation vectors corresponding to slowly growing (or contracting) modes. The qualitatively different features observed between the dynamics of generalized and elastic collisions are discussed in the context of numerical simulations.  Source code and complete descriptions for the simulation models used are provided.",

title = "Near optimal feedback guidance design and the planar restricted three-body problem",
abstract = "In this paper, we present the application of the ZEM/ZEV guidance algorithm to the planar restricted three-body problem (PR3BP). The ZEM/ZEV guidance law as a feedback guidance strategy is presented and applied to the PR3BP. The fuel optimal solution to the PR3BP for a transfer from GTO to L1 in the Earth-Moon system is presented as a point for comparison, showing the near optimality of the closed-loop guidance approach. Challenges of the approach and strategies for implementation in spacecraft mission design are discussed.",
