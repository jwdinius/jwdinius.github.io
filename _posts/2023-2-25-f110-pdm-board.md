# Notes

* Capacitors have polarity - there is an anode (+) and a cathode (-) and you need to make sure to install these components correctly(particularly important for the elecrolytic capacitors).  The anode has a longer lead than the cathode and should be installed in the hole nearest the printed component id (e.g., "C1"); see pic below:
